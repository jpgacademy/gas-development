# TESTING SETUP
The document/script must NOT be in a team folder for the following to work.  
If it is in a team folder you will need to create a NEW Google Cloud Project and associate it with the script.

** This can be copied after the clasp script is run
Copy the script id into the settings.json file.
https://script.google.com/macros/d/<ScriptId>/edit

Then click on "Resources -> Cloud Platform project..." in the script
Enable the Apps Script API
Create and Download the OAuth Client credentials to credentials.json

Run the test file and allow the settings.
IF YOU ran the test file first and there is a token.json file, you need to delete it and rerun the test file.
